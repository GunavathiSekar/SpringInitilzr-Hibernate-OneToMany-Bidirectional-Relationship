        In this Project there si no use of homecontroller and repository class but 
 why we ahs put means if that is there only swagger-ui.html will work but " SWAGGER PAGE WILL SHOW ONLY ERROR BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE ANY METHODS IN 
 HOME CONTROLLER SO, SWAGGER PAGE WILL TAKE ALL THE METHODS BY ITSELF AND TELL YOU THAT ERROR IN THOSE METHODS."
 
    AFTER RUNNINHG LOOK AT THE PAGE http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html/
